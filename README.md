**Brings back the classic Nether from the Legacy Console Editions of Minecraft (Xbox 360, PS3, Wii U, etc.) into modern Minecraft!**

---

## 🕹️ Gameplay Experience

This mod aims to recreate the **feeling of the old Nether from console**:

* Dangerous, empty wastelands.
* Reliance on Ghasts and Blazes for resources.
* Wither Skeletons roaming freely.
* Nether wart spawning on Soul Sand.

If you played the old Xbox 360/PS3/Wii U editions, this will feel instantly familiar.

## 💡 Notes

* Existing Nether chunks will not retroactively change, **explore new chunks** or reset your Nether to experience the full effect.
* Blaze glowstone drops are balanced around the old console mechanics.
