# 📜 Legacy Nether

**Brings back the classic Nether from the Legacy Console Editions of Minecraft (Xbox 360, PS3, Wii U, etc.) into modern Minecraft!**

---

## 🕹️ Gameplay Experience

This mod aims to recreate the **feeling of the old Nether from console**:

* Dangerous, empty wastelands.
* Reliance on Ghasts and Blazes for resources.
* Wither Skeletons roaming freely.
* Nether wart spawning on Soul Sand.

If you played the old Xbox 360/PS3/Wii U editions, this will feel instantly familiar.
